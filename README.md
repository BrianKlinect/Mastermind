# Mastermind

Plays a traditional game of [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) through the console.

Start with Mastermind.App.sln, build the solution, and run Mastermind.App to start playing.

There are configurable settings in Mastermind.BusinessLogic/MastermindGame.cs that can be used to tweak the player experience. These include the length of the secret, the range of digits allowed, and the number of turns.

Mastermind.Tests contains some examples of how accurate a player guess is compared to the secret.
